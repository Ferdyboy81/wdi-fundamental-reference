        <h1>Memory Game</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
        <h3>Why it works</h2>
            <p>I'll publish the source code for this so that anyone can easily edit and make their own custom matching game. I'm sure it would come in really handy for studying as an alternative to flashcards. Concepts can be matched where you actually have to learn how the front and the back are associated before pulling the cards. EX: You flip Cow and Moo those get remoooved. This however is just a proof of concept with Kings and Queens from a normal deck of cards. </p>
